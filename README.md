Problem Statement.

The problem statement requires deploying a sample WordPress website, protecting it with a Nginx reverse proxy, and allowing admin login from a specific IP address only.

Additionally, we must enable log rotation, write a script to analyze Nginx logs, and provide a report.

We must also automate the deployment using either cloud infrastructure automation technology or containers.
